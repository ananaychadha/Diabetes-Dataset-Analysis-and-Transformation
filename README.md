# Diabetes Dataset Analysis and Transformation

This repository contains code for a practical assignment focusing on data preprocessing and exploration of the diabetes dataset. The assignment aims to familiarize students with basic data preprocessing and exploration tools in Python, using concepts discussed in lectures. It covers tasks such as outlier removal, transformation, and data processing, without using dataframe iterations.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this assignment is the diabetes dataset, which includes several medical variables such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and a target variable, Outcome, indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Files Included
- `diabetes.csv`: Data file for the questions.
- `ages.csv`: Additional data file for age group names.
- `Practical-01-B.ipynb`: Python notebook programs.
- `Practical-01-B.html`: Notebook in HTML showing the outputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas 1.3+
- numpy 1.20+
- sklearn 0.24+
- seaborn 0.11+
- matplotlib 3.5+
- scipy 1.9+

## Project Structure
- **Outliers Removal and Transformation:** Tasks include calculating kurtosis and skewness, filtering data, drawing histograms, identifying and correcting outliers, and transforming columns.
- **Data Processing:** Tasks include grouping patients, adding new columns, merging dataframes, and one-hot encoding categorical variables.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the `diabetes.csv` and `ages.csv` files into the project directory.
3. Open the `Practical-01-B.ipynb` notebook and run each cell to execute the code.

## Sure, here's the revised conclusion for the README file:

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with basic tools for data preprocessing and exploration using Python. By completing this practical, students will gain a better understanding of how to clean and transform datasets, as well as how to perform data analysis tasks without using dataframe iterations. The tasks in this assignment cover a range of topics including outlier detection, data transformation, grouping, and merging, which are essential skills for anyone working with data in a professional setting.
